# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

A fun and simple command-line game where you try to guess a number randomly selected by the system between **1 and 100**.

---

## 🕹️ How It Works

- At the start of the game, the system randomly selects a **whole number** between **1 and 100**.
- You try to guess the number.
- After each guess, the system tells you whether your guess was **too low**, **too high**, or **correct**.
- The game continues until you guess the correct number.

## ✅ Rules

- Only **whole numbers** are allowed (no decimals).
- Numbers must be within the range **1 to 100**.
- Invalid input will prompt a warning and ask for a new guess.
